--------
Examples
--------
sample dialplan code for your extensions.conf. In this example the user
dictates his question on the phone and hears back the answer.
(it also uses googletts.agi and speech-recog.agi AGI scripts for
speech synthesis and recognition):

;WolframAlpha query demo:
exten => 1237,1,Answer()
exten => 1237,n,agi(googletts.agi,"What is your question?",en)
	;;Record the question and render it to text:
exten => 1237,n(record),agi(speech-recog.agi,en-US)
exten => 1237,n,GotoIf($[$["${status}" = "0"] & $["${confidence}" > "0.8"]]?success:retry

	;;Submit the question to wolfram:
exten => 1237,n(success),agi(wolfram.agi,"${utterance}")
	;;Playback the answer:
exten => 1237,n,agi(googletts.agi,"${wolfram_answer}",en)
exten => 1237,n,goto(end)

	;;Retry in case speech recognition wasn't successful:
exten => 1237,n(retry),agi(googletts.agi,"Can you please repeat more clearly?",en)
exten => 1237,n,goto(record)

exten => 1237,n(end),Hangup()
